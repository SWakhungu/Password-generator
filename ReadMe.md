# Password Generator
Following up on Scrimba modules on JavaScript, I embarked on this project to specifically test my understanding of control structures in programming and use of the Math object. The objective is to come up with a random password generator, with two options being offered as possible passwords one can use. I took up the challenge of a stretch goal and included a copy-on-click functionality such that one can copy and paste the passwords generated- I think that would be pretty cool and useful. As usual HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are used in varying degrees for full functionality of the app.
