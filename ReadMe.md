# Password Generator
Following up on Scrimba modules on JavaScript, I embarked on this project to specifically test my understanding of control structures in programming and use of the Math object. The objective is to come up with a random password generator, with two options being offered as possible passwords one can use. As usual HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are used in varying degrees for full functionality of the app.
